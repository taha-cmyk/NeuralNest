## Introduction to Python for AI

Python has become the de facto language for artificial intelligence and machine learning development. Its simplicity, readability, and vast ecosystem of libraries make it an ideal choice for both beginners and experts in the field.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before diving into coding, you'll need to set up your Python environment. We recommend using Anaconda, a distribution of Python that comes with many useful packages pre-installed.

### Installing Anaconda

1. Download Anaconda from the [official website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system
3. Verify your installation by opening Anaconda Navigator

## Essential Python Libraries for AI

Python's strength in AI comes from its powerful libraries. Here are some essential ones you should know:

- **NumPy**: For numerical computing and array operations
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: For deep learning

## Your First AI Program in Python

Let's write a simple program that uses scikit-learn to classify iris flowers:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the iris dataset
iris = datasets.load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the model
model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
